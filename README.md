# OptiLCMS

### Introduction

**OptiLCMS** is an R package providing an optimized LC-MS raw data processing workflow. The source code of the "MS Spectral Processing" Module in [MetaboAnalyst](https://dev.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/upload/SpectraUpload.xhtml) is contained here. OptiLCMS can be used to repeat the results generated by MetaboAnalyst at local, and is also optionally dependent by MetaboAnalystR to perform raw MS data processing.
